WARNING: robin-hood-hashing is DEPRECATED

Unfortunately I do not have time to continue development for this hashmap. I have a worthy successor though, please head over to: `ankerl::unordered_dense::{map, set}` https://github.com/martinus/unordered_dense

If you need a very fast unordered map for lookups, you might want to have a look at `boost::unordered_flat_map`.
